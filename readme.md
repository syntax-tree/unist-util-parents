## What is this?

This utility creates a proxy of the tree that acts like the original tree upon
reading, but each proxied node has a reference to its parent node.

## When should I use this?

This package can be very useful for problems where it is needed to figure out
what a nodes ancestors are, because unist itself is a non-cyclical data
structure, and thus does not provide that information.
On the other hand, this info on ancestors can also be gathered when walking the
tree with [`unist-util-visit-parents`][unist-util-visit-parents].

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install unist-util-parents
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {parent} from 'https://esm.sh/unist-util-parents@2'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {parent} from 'https://esm.sh/unist-util-parents@2?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {u} from 'unist-builder'
import {parents} from 'unist-util-parents'

const tree = u('root', [
  u('leaf', 'leaf 1'),
  u('node', [
    u('leaf', 'leaf 2'),
    u('void'),
    u('node', [
      u('leaf', 'leaf 3'),
      u('node', [u('leaf', 'leaf 4')]),
      u('void'),
      u('leaf', 'leaf 5')
    ])
  ])
])

const wrapped = parents(tree)

// Leaf 4
const node = wrapped.children[1].children[2].children[1].children[0]

const chain = []
while (node) {
  chain.push(node.type)
  node = node.parent
}

console.log(chain.reverse())
```

Yields:

```js
['root', 'node', 'node', 'node', 'leaf']
```

## API

This package exports the identifier [`parents`][api-parents].
There is no default export.

### `parents(tree)`

Create a proxy of `tree` that acts like the original tree upon reading, but
each proxied node has a reference to its parent node.

###### Notes

The returned proxy imposes two additional fields on all of its nodes:

*   `parent` — parent link (or `undefined` for the root)
*   `node` — link to the original node

These new fields are not enumerable and the original tree is *not changed*.
This means you can use `JSON.stringify` on the wrapped tree and it’s the same.

`wrapped.children` returns array of wrapped child nodes, so that any recursive
algorithm will work on a wrapped tree just as well.

To write changes to the tree, use `.node` to access the original tree.

###### Parameters

*   `tree` ([`Node`][node])
    — tree to proxy

###### Returns

Proxy of `tree` ([`Proxy`][api-proxy]).

### `Proxy`

A proxy of a [`Node`][node] that adds two additional fields:

*   `parent` — parent link (or `undefined` for the root)
*   `node` — link to the original node

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type [`Proxy`][api-proxy].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `unist-util-parents@^2`,
compatible with Node.js 12.
